# MasC=uerade
This printed circuit board attempts to allow simpler Commodore 64 cartridges to operate on a Commodore 64/SX/128.  It's important to note that this is a very simple design, mainly designed for single purpose I/O cartridges.  Don't get your hopes up too high, as this will not magically allow 64 games to run on the VIC, nor will it allow the TurboChameleon64 to speed up the VIC-20.  Sorry...

## Usage

The jumpers/switches allow the C64 ROML and ROMH lines to be connected to the BLK1,2,3, or 5 lines, and the IO1 and IO2 lines to be connected to IO2 or IO3 on the VIC-20.
